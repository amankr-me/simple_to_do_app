# simple_to_do_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a simple todo app.

To run a Flutter app, you need to follow these steps. This guide assumes you have Flutter and its dependencies installed. If you haven’t installed Flutter yet, you can follow the installation instructions on the Flutter official site.

1. Prepare Your Development Environment

   Install Flutter: Ensure you have Flutter installed. You can check this by running flutter --version in your terminal.
   
   Set Up an Editor: Use an editor like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio, and install the Flutter and Dart plugins.

2. Get the Project

   If you have the project in a version control system (like Git), clone it to your local machine:

git clone repository-url

cd project-directory

If you have the project as a zip file or downloaded directly, extract it and navigate to the project directory.


3. Initialize a New Project Structure

   To create Flutter project structure , run:

   flutter create .

   This command initializes a new Flutter project structure in the current directory.

4. Get Dependencies

   Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

   flutter pub get

   This command installs all the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file.

5. Run the App

   Using an Emulator or Simulator

   Start an Emulator/Simulator:

Android Emulator: Open Android Studio, go to AVD Manager, and start an Android Virtual Device (AVD).

iOS Simulator: Open Xcode, go to Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator, and start an iOS Simulator.
Run the App:

From the Terminal:

flutter run

This will build the app and launch it on the connected device or emulator.

From an Editor:

Visual Studio Code: Open the project folder in VS Code, and use the “Run” or “Start Debugging” option (usually a green play button) from the Debug menu.

Android Studio: Open the project in Android Studio, and click the green “Run” button or use the Run menu.

Using a Physical Device

Connect Your Device:

Android: Enable USB debugging on your Android device and connect it via USB.

iOS: Connect your iOS device and trust the computer if prompted.

Run the App:

From the Terminal:

flutter devices

List all connected devices. Then run:

flutter run -d device-id

Replace device-id with the ID of your connected device.

From an Editor:

Choose your connected device from the device selector in VS Code or Android Studio, then run the app.

6. Hot Reload and Hot Restart

   Hot Reload: While the app is running, you can make changes to your code and press r in the terminal or use the “Hot Reload” button in your editor to see changes instantly.

   Hot Restart: Press R in the terminal or use the “Hot Restart” button in your editor to restart the app and apply changes.

7. Build the App:

flutter build apk   # For Android

flutter build ios   # For iOS

8. Run Unit Tests:

flutter test
